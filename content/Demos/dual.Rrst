This is the demo of the six piecepacks that were included in the `"dual piecepacks" <http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/DualPiecepacks>`_ proof-of-concept: one piecepack-suited piecepack, one `latin-suited <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_(cards)#Origin_and_development_of_the_Latin_suits>`_ piecepack (inverted color scheme), two french-suited piecepacks (one 'black' suits, one 'white' suits), and two `swiss-suited <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_(cards)#Invention_of_the_Germanic_suits>`_ piecepacks (one dark grayscale color scheme, one light grayscale color scheme).  One could use the piecepack-suited, latin-suited, and one of the french-suited piecepacks to build a "trial hoardpack".

Dual piecepacks
---------------

"Dual piecepacks" are eight piecepack **suits** with the following properties:

* The eight **suits** suits can be "easily" visually distinguished
* The eight suits can be "easily" visually split into two separate **groups** of four suits
* Each "suit" in a group can be "easily" visually **linked** with exactly one suit in the other group 

This gives one the following nice properties:

* One can play games requiring one piecepack deck plus an expansion piecepack deck by treating the eight **suits** as separate suits
* One can play games requiring two piecepack decks by treating each pair of **linked** suits as the same suit
* One can play games that are "SixPack" friendly by taking three suits from each visually distinct **group**. One can scale this down to games that are "Playing Cards Expansion" friendly or even scale up to four-grouped-suits versus four-grouped-suits friendly games (like Canadian checkers or Bughouse chess).
* One can play entirely new games provided by the extra layer of relationships. Proof-of-concept new game is `Dual Piecepacks Poker <http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/DualPiecepacksPoker>`_. 

It is possible to construct three piecepacks where each pair of piecepack decks are "dual piecepacks" (e.g. piecepack-suited + inverted latin-suited + light french-suited). This could be called a "trial `HoardPack <http://www.ludism.org/ppwiki/HoardPack>`_" (apparently "trial" is the proper "three" analogue to "dual").
