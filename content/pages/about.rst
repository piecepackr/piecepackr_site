This is the associated website for the piecepackr_ R_ package.  piecepackr_ is an R package designed to make configurable board game graphics. It can be used with the grid_ R package to make board game diagrams, board game animations, and custom Print & Play layouts.  By default it is configured to make `piecepack game`_ diagrams_, animations_, and `Print & Play`_ layouts but can be configured to make graphics for other game systems.

This website contains some documentation_ on how to use piecepackr_ as well as several demos_ using piecepackr_.  It also contains the download links for several `Print & Play`_ pdfs of the piecepacks configured in the `Print & Play demos`_.
